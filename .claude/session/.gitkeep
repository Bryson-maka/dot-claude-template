# This directory holds runtime session data.
# Contents are gitignored and regenerated per-project.
#
# Files created here:
#   state.json    - Current session state (primed_at, execution_journal, etc.)
#   manifest.json - Discovery manifest (domains, files, keywords)
#   history.jsonl - Archived sessions (appended on /cc-conclude)
#
# To reset for a new project:
#   python3 .claude/lib/session_state.py reset
#
# Or simply run /cc-prime-cw which will reinitialize everything.
