# Security Policy: Project-specific overrides for hook tiers
#
# This file lets you customize the security behavior without modifying
# the hook scripts themselves. Hooks read this file at runtime.
#
# The hook system has four tiers:
#   BLOCKED - always denied, never prompts (catastrophic ops, secrets)
#   ASK     - prompts user for confirmation (destructive but legitimate)
#   WARN    - allowed with context warning (side-effect commands)
#   ALLOW   - silent pass-through (everything else)

# Paths where `rm` is downgraded from ASK → WARN (allowed without prompting).
# These are build artifacts / generated dirs that are safe to delete routinely.
# Add your project's generated directories here.
safe_delete_paths:
  - node_modules
  - dist
  - build
  - .next
  - __pycache__
  - .pytest_cache
  - .mypy_cache
  - target       # Rust/Java build output
  - .turbo
  - coverage

# Additional secret files to hard-deny reads on (beyond built-in .env, .pem, etc.)
# Use regex patterns matched against the filename (not full path).
secret_files: []
  # - "firebase-admin.*\\.json"
  # - "gcp-credentials\\.json"
  # - "\\.secrets$"

# Directory-scoped write restrictions (opt-in).
# When configured, Edit/Write/NotebookEdit and Bash file-writing commands
# are denied if the target path falls outside these directories.
# Reads are NOT restricted — only writes.
#
# Paths are relative to the project root. Symlinks are resolved before
# checking, preventing traversal attacks.
#
# To enable: uncomment and list your writable directories.
# To disable: leave as empty list [] or remove the key entirely.
#
# Example for a Python project:
#   allowed_write_directories:
#     - src
#     - tests
#     - docs
#     - .claude/session
#
# Example for a Node project:
#   allowed_write_directories:
#     - src
#     - tests
#     - docs
#     - node_modules
#     - .claude/session
#
# Absolute paths are also supported but discouraged for portability.
# The .claude/ directory itself is always protected by other hooks
# (settings.json and security-policy.yaml writes are hard-denied).
allowed_write_directories: []
