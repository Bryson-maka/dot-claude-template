# Domain Definitions for Context Priming Analysts
#
# This file contains BASE domain definitions that apply to most projects.
# Project-specific domains are auto-discovered by /cc-learn and stored
# in .claude/project_config.yaml, which is merged at runtime.
#
# To customize for your project:
# 1. Run /cc-learn to auto-discover patterns
# 2. Or manually add domains below
#
# The discovery script merges:
#   1. project_config.yaml domains (if exists) - highest priority
#   2. These base domains - fallback defaults

domains:
  # ========== Universal Base Domains ==========
  # These apply to nearly all software projects
